Using the spotify API, Personify allows users to view their top spotify tracks and artists and recently played songs. Users can also choose to filter search results based on all time, past 6 months and past month. Users can also get recommendations based on their previously listened to tracks and albums and can also create playlists which will appear on their spotify account

This project was created completely from scratch with nextJS and uses server-side-rendering. Authentication is done with next-auth.
